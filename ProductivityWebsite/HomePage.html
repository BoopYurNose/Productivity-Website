           <h2>This is a site, that I made as a tool to track my productivity. Regularly I will journal daily,<br>
               and write down a list of all the tasks I want to get done everyday in a journal.<br>
               I wanted to make a website where I can:
               <ol>
                   <li>Log what I'm doing everyday (like a blog)</li>
                   <li>Allow me to add items to a to-do list</li>
                   <li>Allows me to tick off items on a to-do list and changes my productivity score depending on how many I ticked off</li>
                   <li>Rates my productivity score (percentage based on how many tasks I got done that day)</li>
                   <li>Track sleep, Coding time, Drawing time, etc</li>
                   <li>show progress chart overtime using data from previous days</li>
               </ol>

               
           </h2>
        </div>
           <h3>(NOTE: Currently I have only made the To-Do-List and DailyLog part of the site. This is because the other parts require programming in Java <br>
               which I do not know how to program in that language YET as of 12/9/25. I might come back to this after I've learnt to code in java and implement <br>
               those pages because I mean sure I could easily just copy code of the internet but I'd just be cheating myself out of actually learning anything)<br>
               I hope you enjoy
