       <h1>Welcome to my daily log!ᕦ(⩾﹏⩽)ᕥ <br>
        I mostly only write how I'm feeling in a journal, This is literally me just copying what I already have from my real journal into this.<br>
    How it works:</h1>
        <h2>I will write how I'm feeling, what I'm thinking about, or anything on my mind really. <br>
        Then I'll end it with saying 5 things I am grateful for because I think having gratitude for <br>
        stuff in your life makes you a overall better person.</h2>
